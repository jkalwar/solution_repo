## Fully working API is hosted in an azure paas service as [ML Training API](http://ml-training-api.azurewebsites.net/)

### The script for testing the API is present in the scripts folder : ml_api_test.py
### The ml_api_test script will interactively take the user though the API endpoints for the following :
* Creating the model
* Uploading the images of the user
* Training the model
* Testing the model
* An api endpoint to get the best accuracy details for a specific model.

### I have added a couple of images I have used for testing.

### Assumptions and details about the work are mentioned in the top section of ml_api_test.py script as comments.
